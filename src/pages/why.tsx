        As someone who frequents the news site, more so as a spectator rather
        than a contributor, I&apos;ve felt it cut short in places that I&apos;ve
        been spoilt into taking for granted by a few other apps. While I
        don&apos;t like the reddit UI a lot with the redesign, apps like &nbsp;
        <HyperLink href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575">
          Apollo
        </HyperLink>{" "}
        &nbsp; and &nbsp;
        <HyperLink href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync">
          Sync
        </HyperLink>{" "}
        &nbsp; have made it a joy to browse/read through.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        So I&apos;ve tried to implement some sort of balance to this one which
        makes it a significantly better experience for me (
        <i>and hopefully others</i>) to read.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Some changes that <strong>hckrnws</strong> makes in an attempt to
        improve the experience are:
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: "none" }}>
          <li>
            <Text>
              <Points color={1}>Dark Mode</Points> - Someone who tends to read
              in the night, I&apos;m annoyed at the fact that hacker news is a
              bright light shining out of my screen. Sure there&apos;s
              extensions and other stuff that try to help the cause, but if
              I&apos;m going to make the app, might as well ship with native
              dark mode. Fear not, a light version also exists!
            </Text>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Text>
              <Points color={2}>Compact Reading</Points> - Reduced width of the
              readable area to 1200px since on larger screens, reading comments
              is a pain. Also increased font sizes and went with a font (
              <i>IBM Plex Sans</i>) that is easy on the eye.
            </Text>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Text>
              <Points color={3}>Highlighted Comment Threads</Points> - Comments
              are easily identifiable as who is who&apos;s child in long
              threads, with a Apollo/Sync style vertical collapsable line. Also,
              an easier way to identify the OP in the comments. (colored and has
              a badge beside them).

              <Points color={5}>Read Later</Points> - A Read Later section for
              saving stories for easier access once the day ends. (
              <i>in the works</i>)

        Over time I&apos;d be adding a couple of features as my usage goes such
        as the ability to change to Mono/Serif fonts, increasing font sizes, and
        other sections like Show HN.
